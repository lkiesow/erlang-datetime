%% According to the RFC822 a year is only represented by its two last digits.
%% This function provides some methods for expanding those short year
%% representations to a full year. You can choose between the following
%% expansion rules:
%%  smart             If the two digit year is less or equal of the two last
%%                    digits of the current year, assume that the date is from
%%                    the current century. Otherwise assume that the date is
%%                    from last century.
%%                    Example (Current year is 2012):
%%                      12  will become  2012
%%                      34  will become  1934
%%                      05  will become  2005
%%  current_century   It is assumed that all dates are from this century.
%%  no_alternation    No alternation is done. Thus two digit years stay as they
%%                    are.
%%  DIGIT             DIGIT may be any integer. Using this method you can
%%                    specify a concrete century. This number is basically
%%                    added to the two digit year. Thus 34 with DIGIT = 1800
%%                    will become 1834.

%% datetime_encode( DateTime, TimeZone, SpecType )

%%
%% DateTime must be of the form {{Year,Month,Day},{Hour,Minute,Second}}. This
%%          form is returned for example by the erlang functions
%%          universaltime() or localtime().
%% TimeZone has to be a zone according to RFC822 or RFC2822. Additional time
%%          zones may be accepted in the future.
%% SpecType can be either 'rfc822', 'rfc2822' or 'rss'. Both specifications are
%%         basically the same except for the length of the year. RSS supports
%%         both, two and four digit years while rfc882 only accepts two digit
%%         year representation. rfc2822 basically equals the RSS
%%         specifications.
%%         Important: Some specifications of rfc2882 marked as obsolete and
%%         comments are not supported at the moment. At they will probably
%%         never be supported as they are basically never used in the real
